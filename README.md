# Titanic-ForKaggle
This is my attempt on a classic ML problem on Kaggle, Titanic Survival Prediction

## Motivation for the Project:
The reason why I chose this project, is that I wanted to get started with Kaggle competitions since I ever found out about them, which was like 6 months ago.
After hours digging on the Internet, I found out that "Titanic Prediction" is the best way for a beginner like me to understand how "Kaggle Competitions" work, and how to put a submission for the competition.
So, after my end-semester exams finished, I put this project as my number 1 priority, and did it!
